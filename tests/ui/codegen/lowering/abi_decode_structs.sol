// `abi.decode` into structs, struct arrays, and mixed tuples routes through
// shared type-keyed helpers from the recursive materializer that also decodes
// struct parameters: static structs read directly from their heads, dynamic
// structs and struct arrays follow their tail offsets, and nested aggregates
// become memory pointers. Verified
// behaviorally against solc, including a static sub-struct followed by
// dynamic fields (whose head sizing previously mis-offset later fields).
